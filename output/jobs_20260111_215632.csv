We 💛 small scaling businesses. Since 2013, we’ve been building a CRM that focuses on better communication, without the hassle of manual data entry or a complex UI. We are out to supercharge sales productivity with the most modern, thoughtfully designed, all-in-one, communication-focused CRM.

Our backend tech stack consists primarily of Python Flask web apps with our TaskTiger scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis.

We also use these images in our local development environment allowing coding locally against all of our services. We have a well-documented public API that is consumed by our front-end JavaScript app as well as numerous integrations. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using Terraform, Ansible and other AWS tools.

Our product development process is inspired by Shape Up. We love open sourcing our code and ideas on our GitHub and on The Making of Close, our behind-the-scenes Product & Engineering blog. Check out our open source projects like SocketShark, TaskTiger, LimitLion and ciso8601.

You will work closely with quantitative developers, analysts, and other stakeholders to deliver high-quality, maintainable solutions that advance our technical capabilities and streamline analytical workflows.

This is a hands-on engineering role focused on building and improving the tools and platforms that support our investment process. While it does not directly involve leveraging agentic AI systems, machine learning and data analysis, your work will directly enable development in these areas.

We enjoy problem solving with domain experts across a multi-strategy enterprise. We apply powerful patterns and tools to form a seamless and opinionated way of working that is easy for new and existing users to adopt.

Responsibilities
• Design, develop, and maintain Python-based systems to support quantitative research and investment analysis
• Collaborate with stakeholders to understand objectives and deliver solutions aligned with our technical roadmap
• Engage regularly with technical counterparts on the investment team to develop coherent solutions that leverage core systems
• Improve the architecture, performance, and reliability of existing systems
• Enhance monitoring, automation, and CI/CD workflows to increase efficiency and platform stability
• Establish and document design standards and promote best practices across development teams
• Contribute to technical recruiting, onboarding, mentorship, and code reviews for analysts, interns, and developers

• Strong understanding of software architecture, design principles, and package management
• Experience developing libraries or tools for use by other developers in production environments
• Excellent communication and collaboration skills with a strong customer-focused mindset
• Familiarity with SQL, Spark, Databricks, and Data Science libraries such as pandas and numpy preferred

Ws41jgUNn9uFXim5AAAAAA==,ziprecruiter,Data Scientist,Jerry.ai,"Newark, New Jersey, US",,,USD,full-time,senior,on-site,"You could be a data scientist anywhere. Why us?
• Join a pre-IPO startup with capital, traction and runway ($240M funded | 60X revenue growth in 5 years | $2T market size)
• Partner with our VP of Data Science & Analytics, Armando La Rocca (ex-BCG, Better)
• Disrupt a massive market and take us to a $10B business in the next few years
• Be immersed in a talent-dense environment and greatly accelerate your career growth

About the opportunity:

Jerry is looking for a Data Scientist to join our growing team! We hit a huge milestone in early 2024 by achieving profitability and have ambitious goals for the next few years - scale from 5M to 50M customers and become a $10B business. As a data scientist, you will play a key role in championing data-driven decisions across the company's most critical business initiatives (including carrier growth and development, building new products from 0-1, etc.). As part of the data science & analytics team, you will leverage advanced machine learning models to conduct in-depth analyses and extract insights that will shape our growth strategies.

Jerry is building the first super app to make car ownership affordable and accessible - insurance, buy/sell, registration, loans, safety, repairs, parking, etc - a $2T market in the U.S. We started with insurance in 2019, and since then we've launched loan refinancing, driving insights, repair marketplace, car diagnostics, and a GenAI-powered chatbot & voicebot. We have amassed over 5M customers, raised $240MM in funding, scaled our revenue 60X and our team to 225 across 6 countries.

Here's what an ex-BCG teammate has to say about joining Jerry:

""The biggest difference between my current role at Jerry and my past life at BCG is being able to feel the direct impact my work has on the business, every day. In consulting, I rarely felt like my work was having any impact on the world, despite advising the largest global corporations. Here, I can see that my work is moving the needle on key company metrics in a matter of weeks. When I say ""key,"" I mean it: I am not talking about secondary KPIs that no one pays attention to, but business-critical metrics that the CEO and the rest of the C-suite look at on a daily basis (think sales, retention, pricing, etc).

The benefit of being a digital-first company is that we are sitting on a treasure trove of data. This means we almost never have to make a decision that's not backed by a robust, statistically significant analysis. While data science can be a support function in some other places (this was something I wanted to avoid), data scientists at Jerry are at the core of the business.

I have also appreciated the professional growth opportunities. I have had flexibility to work on the skills I wanted to develop, be it technical or soft skills. I have found continuous learning to be one of my most important drivers of happiness at work. Getting the space and latitude to work on projects that I am most interested in was all the more important for this reason.""

How you will make an impact:
• Partner with marketing, product, and business development teams to integrate customer performance insights into user and partner acquisition strategies
• Lead the design, execution, and analysis of A/B experiments on new and existing features, extracting key insights to inform product and business strategies
• Define, understand, and test levers to drive profitable and scalable user acquisition and partnership growth
• Identify opportunities to automate manual processes and optimize operational efficiency

Preferred experience:
• Bachelor's degree in a quantitatively or intellectually rigorous discipline
• 1+ years of experience from a top-tier economic consulting firm (Analysis Group, Cornerstone Research, Charles River Associates preferred) OR 1+ years of management consulting experience from a top firm (McKinsey, Bain, and Boston Consulting Group preferred) OR relevant experience in data science/business analysis
• High level of comfort with SQL or Python

Who you are:
• You have a framework for problem solving and live by first principles
• You are comfortable communicating with audiences varying from front-line employees to the company's C-suite
• You set a very high bar for yourself and for your team, and you are constantly pushing that bar higher in the pursuit of excellence

• Build and maintain versioning, change tracking, and provenance systems for all data and relationships
• Develop the framework that allows users to build custom knowledge graphs from the analyses they run inside Mithrl
• Build features that allow users to explore, query, and interact with their graphs
• Work closely with ML engineers, bioinformatics teams, and discovery application teams to ensure the knowledge graph supports downstream reasoning and analysis
• Validate the correctness, completeness, and integrity of the knowledge graph across releases

WHAT YOU BRING

Required Qualifications
• Strong experience in data science, bioinformatics, computational biology, or a related field
• Experience working with biological knowledgebases, public datasets, or ontology driven systems

• Experience with public consortia such as ENCODE, GTEx, TCGA, or ChEMBL, etc.
• Prior experience in a tech bio startup or scientific software environment

WHAT YOU WILL LOVE AT MITHRL
• You will build the core knowledge layer that the AI Co-Scientist uses to reason about biology
• Team: Join a tight‑knit, talent-dense team of engineers, scientists, and builders
• Culture: We value consistency, clarity, and hard work. We solve hard problems through focused daily execution
• Speed: We ship fast (2x/week) and improve continuously based on real user feedback
• Location: Beautiful SF office with a high‑energy, in‑person culture
• Benefits: Comprehensive PPO health coverage through Anthem (medical, dental, and vision) + 401(k) with top‑tier plans

We encourage you to apply even if you do not believe you meet every single qualification. Not all strong candidates will meet every single qualification as listed. Research shows that people who identify as being from underrepresented groups are more prone to experiencing imposter syndrome and doubting the strength of their candidacy, so we urge you not to exclude yourself prematurely and to submit an application if you're interested in this work. We think AI systems like the ones we're building have enormous social and ethical implications. We think this makes representation even more important, and we strive to include a range of diverse perspectives on our team.",,Python,https://jobs.womenforhire.com/job/usa/burlingame-ca/data-scientist-knowledge-graphs-351566/?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic,2026-01-08,2026-01-11 21:56:24,
