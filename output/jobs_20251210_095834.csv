hvbtlq_MjSNYNtLnAAAAAA==,google_jobs,"Senior Data Scientist, AI",Gloo,,,,USD,full-time,senior,hybrid,"The Opportunity:

Join Gloo’s AI Research & Data Science team and turn frontier LLM research into evidence-backed product decisions that help people grow. You’ll own the end-to-end experimentation loop—from designing causal tests and faith-aligned evaluation metrics to automating dashboards that keep model quality, bias, and cost in check. Pastors, parents, and everyday seekers will trust the insights we deliver because you’ll make sure the data behind them is rock-solid.

Your day-to-day blends hands-on analytics with strategic impact:
• Morning: run a power analysis on yesterday’s live-traffic experiment, then pull terabytes of telemetry from Snowflake to fine-tune a hallucination detector in PyTorch.
• Mid-day: pair with an ML engineer to wire your new “faith-alignment” score into the CI pipeline so every model checkpoint is auto-graded before it hits staging.
• Afternoon: present a causal-impact report to product and design, translating statistical nuance into a clear go/no-go decision for next week’s launch.

You won’t do it alone. You’ll collaborate daily with research scientists, backend engineers, PMs, and Design who care as deeply about human flourishing as they do about clean code. Together you’ll ship world-class eval suites, trusted data pipelines, and self-service insights that let others build on our work.

If you’re ready to trade big-tech bureaucracy for autonomy, mission, and the chance to invent what doesn’t exist yet, we’d love to meet you. This role has a strong preference for candidates based in the Pittsburgh, PA area, with a hybrid work arrangement, but we are open to remote work for the right individual.

What You’ll Do:
Research & Technical Excellence
• Design gold-standard evaluation pipelines. Build offline + online test harnesses that quantify accuracy, hallucination, bias, latency, cost, and faith alignment for every new model checkpoint—then light them up in CI so bad pushes never reach staging.
• Invent metrics that matter. Translate “human flourishing” into measurable signals (e.g., uplift scores, pastoral-fit indices) and validate them with causal inference, inter-rater reliability, and power analyses.
• Champion testability at data scale. Instrument data pipelines to emit lineage, privacy flags, and drift stats; automate regression and shadow-traffic tests so research moves fast without breaking trust.
• Advance the craft. Publish internal whitepapers, run journal clubs on causal ML and LLM evaluation, and mentor engineers in statistical thinking and experiment design.
Delivery
• Ship decision-ready insights. Own the end-to-end loop—from query in Snowflake or Weaviate, through feature engineering in PyTorch, to a Looker dashboard or Slack bot that PMs use daily.
• Accelerate cycles, not risk. Template experiment frameworks (A/B, switchback, Bayesian bandits) so product teams can launch tests in hours; automate cleanup, analysis, and “stop/keep/scale” recommendations.
Raise the performance ceiling. Hunt bottlenecks—slow ETL, expensive inference, noisy labels—and knock them down with better schemas, caching, or active-learning pipelines.
Strategic Clarity
• Align analytics with mission. Partner with product and research to frame how new metrics, datasets, or safety guardrails power coaching, discipleship, and broader human-flourishing outcomes.
• Model trade-offs. Quantify the ROI of additional GPU spend, bigger context windows, or stricter privacy filters, then brief execs with clear “yes / later / never” options.
• Codify best practice. Keep living docs on metrics definitions, experiment checklists, and data-governance rules so every team can self-serve without reinventing the wheel.
Collaboration
• Default to cross-functional. Pair with infra on scalable data stores, with security on PII governance, and with UX on in-product instrumentation that captures the right events the first time.
• Create productive tension. Ask the hard statistical questions early, surface risks, and drive “disagree-and-commit” clarity so launches stay both fast and safe.
Leadership & Influence
• Mentor over manage. Coach junior analysts and engineers; review code, notebooks, and dashboards to raise the team’s statistical bar.
• Lead from the data. When the numbers disagree with intuition, speak up—candidly but constructively—then rally the group around evidence-based solutions.
• Institutionalize learning. Run retros on every major experiment, celebrate lessons (wins or fails), and bake micro-improvements into the next cycle.

In short: you’ll turn terabytes of raw signals into trustworthy metrics, experiments, and narratives that keep our AI honest and our mission on track—ensuring every insight we ship genuinely helps someone flourish.

What We Are Looking For:
• Advanced degree or demonstrable equivalent (peer-reviewed research or high-impact data-science products).
• 5+ years in product or research data-science roles designing experiments and shipping insights.
• Expert SQL and Python (Pandas, NumPy); own end-to-end ETL → analysis → dashboard.
• Deep fluency in causal inference, A/B and switchback testing, and metric design.
• Proven ability to evaluate or partner on large-model analytics; familiarity with LLM eval best practices.
• Skilled communicator who turns statistical nuance into decisive recommendations.
Preferred Qualifications
• Hands-on LLM evaluation or bias-audit work; prompt analysis tooling.
• Modern MLOps familiarity (Ray, Airflow, Kubernetes) and GPU cost telemetry.
• Publications at NeurIPS/ICML/KDD or open-source repos > 500 stars.
• Prior work in mission-driven or faith-aligned settings.

Virta Health is pioneering a new standard of care for people to reclaim their lives. We are in the midst of a public health crisis: obesity rates are at an all-time high and over half of US adults have type 2 diabetes or prediabetes, and despite billions spent on new treatments, outcomes are largely worse. Virta reverses these diseases and delivers life-changing results by pairing individualized nutrition with ongoing care from a clinical support team. We have raised over $350 million from top-tier investors, and partner with the largest health plans, employers, and government organizations to help their employees and members restore their health and take back their lives.

Role Overview

The Advanced Analytics & AI (AAA) team is accountable for both pioneering new classes of data that power our business, and ensuring that data is powerful, clear, correct and easy to use throughout the company. The team collaborates closely with the engineering, product development, commercial, and clinical teams to transform data into actionable insights that propel Virta's mission forward.

As a Senior Data Scientist on the AAA team, you will play a crucial role in shaping our data-driven decision making processes and in driving impactful insights that advance our mission. This role offers a unique blend of hands-on coding and strategic leadership, working closely in partnership with the Product Development group that supports adoption of our member-facing products. You will get a chance to work closely with stakeholders to create impactful data-driven reports and analyses that strengthen Virta’s value proposition.

Responsibilities
• Serve as data lead for the Adoption Squad:
• Understand the product – strategy, goals, roadmap, users – deeply enough to identify high-impact, strategic opportunities and risks.
• Use data to steer conversations: bring data-driven hypotheses, challenge assumptions, frame trade-offs, prioritize strategically.
• Translate vague product hunches into sharp analytical questions, and design the right approach to answer them.
• Be the source of truth for KPIs and product metrics: help define and monitor them, and identify trends and drivers.
• Drive decision making with data: Prioritize analyses that meaningfully inform product decisions and change outcomes, reframe analysis requests that won’t do that into ones that will, and design and deliver the resulting analyses properly and rapidly.
• Lead experimentation thoughtfully: guide the team on when and when not to experiment, help enable self-serve experimentation, and focus on frequent, small experiments to speed learning.
• Identify where product strategy and ideas could be better, more easily, or more quickly implemented with the help of AI (ML or GenAI), and help enable this integration.
• Show up as a collaborative leader, not simply a service provider, and help focus work on what matters most.
• Work end-to-end to translate clinical, member, and claims data from our data warehouse into actionable recommendations: work with stakeholders to design reports and dashboards that answer real business questions, design the data flows to support these, and build the required data transformation pipelines.

Must-Haves
• Experience working at a digital health or similar startup, preferably during the growth phase, in order to function effectively in a fast-paced, rapidly changing environment.
• 7+ years of experience in a Healthcare Analytics or Data Science role, working with large datasets and conducting statistical and quantitative modeling, melding analytics with strong programming, data mining, clustering and segmentation.
• 5+ years of work experience working data science and visualization tools (SQL, R, and/or Python)
• Advanced understanding of data storage, ETL frameworks, data transformation, and validation
• Experience in building BI dashboards using tools such as Looker or Tableau
• Ability to explain technology, techniques and approaches to others

Nice-to-Haves
• Experience leading cross-functional efforts to build scalable systems and data pipelines, working with complex data structures
• Understanding of Generative AI concepts and basic usage of GenAI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
• Experience building pipelines using dbt
• Demonstrated project management experience

90 Day Plan

Within your first 90 days at Virta, we expect you will do the following:
• Familiarize yourself with the Advanced Analytics & AI team roles and responsibilities. Get a pulse on team structure, key stakeholders, and areas for opportunity with an eye towards scalability and standardization.
• Integrate with the Adoption Squad to understand team dynamics, analyze key product features and data pipelines, and familiarize yourself with the Squad’s product roadmap
• Analyze current member journey to understand Virta’s technology ecosystem
• Meet cross-functional stakeholders to understand how their business needs align with Squad and Team goals
• Identify at least 1 area of opportunity to leverage GenAI to increase team efficiency or improve our processes
• Teach and inspire your team members through knowledge sharing, pair programming, and giving feedback during code reviews

Values-driven culture

Virta’s company values drive our culture, so you’ll do well if:
• You put people first and take care of yourself, your peers, and our patients equally
• You have a strong sense of ownership and take initiative while empowering others to do the same
• You prioritize positive impact over busy work
• You have no ego and understand that everyone has something to bring to the table regardless of experience
• You appreciate transparency and promote trust and empowerment through open access of information

0kmXudckSSZgZKa0AAAAAA==,google_jobs,Senior Data Scientist,Virta Health,"Chula Vista, California, US",,,USD,full-time,senior,on-site,"Virta Health is pioneering a new standard of care for people to reclaim their lives. We are in the midst of a public health crisis: obesity rates are at an all-time high and over half of US adults have type 2 diabetes or pre-diabetes, and despite billions spent on new treatments, outcomes are largely worse. Virta reverses these diseases and delivers life-changing results by pairing individualized nutrition with ongoing care from a clinical support team. We have raised over $350 million from top-tier investors, and partner with the largest health plans, employers, and government organizations to help their employees and members restore their health and take back their lives.

Role Overview

The Advanced Analytics & AI (AAA) team is accountable for both pioneering new classes of data that power our business, and ensuring that data is powerful, clear, correct and easy to use throughout the company. The team collaborates closely with the engineering, product development, commercial, and clinical teams to transform data into actionable insights that propel Virta's mission forward.

As a Senior Data Scientist on the AAA team, you will play a crucial role in shaping our data-driven decision making processes and in driving impactful insights that advance our mission. This role offers a unique blend of hands-on coding and strategic leadership, working closely in partnership with the Product Development group that supports adoption of our member-facing products. You will get a chance to work closely with stakeholders to create impactful data-driven reports and analyses that strengthen Virta’s value proposition.

Responsibilities
• Serve as data lead for the Retention Squad:
• Understand the product – strategy, goals, roadmap, users – deeply enough to identify high-impact, strategic opportunities and risks.
• Use data to steer conversations: bring data-driven hypotheses, challenge assumptions, frame trade-offs, prioritize strategically.
• Translate vague product hunches into sharp analytical questions, and design the right approach to answer them.
• Be the source of truth for KPIs and product metrics: help define and monitor them, and identify trends and drivers.
• Drive decision making with data: Prioritize analyses that meaningfully inform product decisions and change outcomes, reframe analysis requests that won’t do that into ones that will, and design and deliver the resulting analyses properly and rapidly.
• Lead experimentation thoughtfully: guide the team on when and when not to experiment, help enable self-serve experimentation, and focus on frequent, small experiments to speed learning.
• Identify where product strategy and ideas could be better, more easily, or more quickly implemented with the help of AI (ML or GenAI), and help enable this integration.
• Show up as a collaborative leader, not simply a service provider, and help focus work on what matters most.
• Work end-to-end to translate clinical, member, and claims data from our data warehouse into actionable recommendations: work with stakeholders to design reports and dashboards that answer real business questions, design the data flows to support these, and build the required data transformation pipelines.

Must-Haves
• Experience working at a digital health or similar startup, preferably during the growth phase, in order to function effectively in a fast-paced, rapidly changing environment.
• 7+ years of experience in a Healthcare Analytics or Data Science role, working with large datasets and conducting statistical and quantitative modeling, melding analytics with strong programming, data mining, clustering and segmentation.
• 5+ years of work experience working data science and visualization tools (SQL, R, and/or Python)
• Advanced understanding of data storage, ETL frameworks, data transformation, and validation
• Experience in building BI dashboards using tools such as Looker or Tableau
• Ability to explain technology, techniques and approaches to others

Nice-to-Haves
• Experience leading cross-functional efforts to build scalable systems and data pipelines, working with complex data structures
• Understanding of Generative AI concepts and basic usage of GenAI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
• Experience building pipelines using dbt
• Demonstrated project management experience

90 Day Plan

Within your first 90 days at Virta, we expect you will do the following:
• Familiarize yourself with the Advanced Analytics & AI team roles and responsibilities. Get a pulse on team structure, key stakeholders, and areas for opportunity with an eye towards scalability and standardization.
• Integrate with the Retention Squad to understand team dynamics, analyze key product features and data pipelines, and familiarize yourself with the Squad’s product roadmap
• Analyze current member journey to understand Virta’s technology ecosystem
• Meet cross-functional stakeholders to understand how their business needs align with Squad and Team goals
• Identify at least 1 area of opportunity to leverage GenAI to increase team efficiency or improve our processes
• Teach and inspire your team members through knowledge sharing, pair programming, and giving feedback during code reviews

Values-driven culture

Virta’s company values drive our culture, so you’ll do well if:
• You put people first and take care of yourself, your peers, and our patients equally
• You have a strong sense of ownership and take initiative while empowering others to do the same
• You prioritize positive impact over busy work
• You have no ego and understand that everyone has something to bring to the table regardless of experience
• You appreciate transparency and promote trust and empowerment through open access of information
• You are evidence-based and prioritize data and science over seniority or dogma
• You take risks and rapidly iterate
